# SeaExplorerLanguage
This is a simple sea-themed programming language called the Sea Explorer Language. 

The purpose of this language is to learn more about marine life in a fun and interactive setting. You can explore by swimming, diving, and discovering different sea creatures. Depending on the depth you have gone down to, you can discover three different groups of sea creatures. These groups include those found in shallow waters and reefs, those found in coastal waters to open ocean, and those found in the deep sea.

This language is created with the help of textX, which is used to create the meta-models and parser for the Sea Explorer Language. The interpreter for the Sea Explorer Language is programmed in Python.

To run this code, make sure you have Python and textX installed, as well as Graphviz so that you can see a visual representation of sample programs 1-3 (labeled SEprogram1-3.dot after the program is run) and the Sea Explorer textX grammar (labeled SeaExplorer_meta.dot after the program is run). Also make sure to install PIL (Pillow) and download the images in the Images Folder so that you can see the images and captions on them as output to the sample programs.

The website for the Sea Explorer Language can be found in the index.html file or in the Pages of this repository. The website contains a link to a Slide Presentation with more information about the Sea Explorer Language as well as tutorial videos of sample programs 1-3.
