# SeaExplorerLanguage
This is a simple Sea Explorer Language.
This language is created with the help of textX, which is used to create the meta-models and parser for the Sea Explorer language.

To run this code make sure you have python and textX installed, as well as Graphviz so that you can see a visual representation of sample programs 1-3 (labeled SEprogram1-3.dot) and the Sea Explorer textX grammar (labeled SeaExplorer_meta.dot).
